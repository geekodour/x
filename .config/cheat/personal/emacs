# general note
  i am just getting started with doom, some of the things here are supposed to
  become muscle memory or atleast which-key is supposed to help. So I'll keep
  updating, removing things from this cheatsheet often based on my personal
  journey into emacs

# concept and theory
  # keys
  - 'modifier': certain keys
    - ctrl (C) : Control key
    - left alt (M) : Meta key
    - windows key (s) : Super key
    - space key (SPC) : Leader key (evil mode)
  - 'chord': modifier keys pressed with a single non-modifier key
    - Eg. C-c, M-x, S-v, C-S-v
  - 'sequence': series of chords, pressed and released in row
    - Eg. C-x C-c

  # layout
  | Object      | Description                                           |
  | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
  | buffer      | buffers are assigned to windows. text you are editing |
  |             | in emacs resides in an object called a window.        |
  | window      | window displays a mode                                |
  | mode-line   | windows contain a mode-line at the bottom             |
  | mini-buffer | located at the bottom of emacs. It is used for the    |
  |             | evil ex command line among other things.              |
  | frame/tab   | holds multiple windows, other names: workspace        |
  | session     | TODO                                                  |
  | major-mode  | each buffer usually has only one major mode, eg.      |
  |             | filetype. modes have their own keymaps                |
  | minor-mode  | buffer can have multiple minor modes that can be      |
  |             | toggled on and off, eg. flyspell-mode                 |
  | vim modes   | vim modes are called states in evil mode              |

# usage
  # basic
  - C-g : To get out of fuckups (MOST IMPORTANT)
  - SPC-p-p : list projects
  - ESC/C-g : usually quits the minibuffer
  - M-x <mode-name> : switch major mode
  - M-: : evaluate an expression in the minibuffer, also can use eshell
  - SPC-h-m : Show active modes in buffer
  - SPC-i : insert shit
  - SPC-o-p : toggle sidebar (treemacs in our case)
  - select codeblock + = : to auto-format codeblock
  - SPC-m : local leader key (this gives different keys based on the mode you're on or something similar)
  - gc to comment/uncomment a bunch of text
  - if in cases, intent fucks up, just to SPC-t-i (toggle it back and forth)
  - in a wrong spelling, z= for correcting it.
  - SHIFT-k : for any documentation/signature
  - SPC-c-d : Go to def
  - C-/ : company-complete
  - M-x describe-mode : Documentation for current major and minor modes

  # treemacs
  - ? : keybindings
  - c-{f,d} : create file/dir
  - treemacs-edit-workspaces edit project workspaces in org-mode

  # avy
  - g-s-SPC : open search in buffer

  ######
  # org-mode
  ######
  - SPC-n
  - M-{j,k} : Move headings/listings up or down(re-order)
  - M-{h,l} : Move headings/listings up or down(re-promote)
  - M-RET : in lists, starts a new item in the numbered/non-numbered list
  - S-TAB : Toggle outline at different levels
    - TAB or z to toggle outline at individual levels
  - <s-TAB : code block
    - SPC-m-' : open codeblock in separate buffer (org edit special)
  - when in deft-mode, C-c will open deft options
  - when in calandar buffer, shift+arrow keys will move you in the calandar
  # todo
    - setting dates: SPC-m-d
    - change todo status: SPC-m-t
    - change priority: SPC-m-p-p
  # org-roam
    - some options are under SPC-n-r and some when in the org file, SPC-m-m
    - z i : toggle images
    - ctrl+return : When inserting immediate node and fuzzy match is happening on new node name
    - emacsclient -e '(cf/hugo-export-all "~/notes/org/roam")' 
  # babel
    - C-c C-c : Execute
    - C-c ' : Open code in a buffer

  # buffers
  - SPC-b-b or SPC-, : List buffers in workspace
  - multi-cursor:
    - select and press R to select all in the current buffer
    - select and press M-d(next) M-D(previous)

  # coding
  - flycheck-consult : This will list all the liniting issues from the buffer in one place.

  # deft
  In deft buffer, searching and filtering is somewhat cumbersome
  - Better to use C-c C-f to open the find mini buffer and do all search/select operations from there
  
  # workspace
  - SPC-TAB-TAB : List tabs
  - SPC-TAB-d : Delete current workspace (switches to other existing workspace)

  # snippets
  - M-x yas-describe-table

  # artist-mode
  - M-x artist-mode
  - Toggle evil-emacs-state with C-z, if facing issues
  - Note: If inside org-mode, use src: artist and then C-c '
  - Left Mouse: Draw

  # doom
  - doom upgrade: Update doom and packages
  - SPC-f-p : Open dooms private config directory

  # ibuffer
  d : mark for delete(buffer)
  x : commit changes

  # winner-mode (window)
  C-w m m : Maximize
  C-w u : Undo window (back to old window layout)

  # tangle from cli
