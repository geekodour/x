# list all explicitly installed native packages which are not deps to anything
# else:
pacman -Qetn

# list all packages installed from aur(foreign packages):
pacman -Qm

# lists installed packages no longer available (anywhere):
ancient-packages

# fuzzy search a package to ext database when the results are too long, the
# terms can be from the description too:
pacman -Ss <term1> <term2>

# fuzzy search an installed package:
pacman -Qs <term1> <term2>

# show details on an installed package, this also shows required
# by and deps etc:
pacman -Qi <package_name>

# list all files owned by a given package:
pacman -Ql <package_name>

# remove a package and its dependencies which are not required by any other
# installed package:
pacman -Rs <package_name>

# check for packages that were installed(both native and foreign) as a
# dependency but now, no other packages depend on them. (orphans):
pacman -Qtd

# clean orphaned packages
pacman -Rs $(pacman -Qqtd)

# orphaned files not owned by any arch packages:
lostfiles

# view the dependency tree of a package: 
pactree <package_name> : dependencies
pactree -r <package_name> : dependants 

# clean the package cache
paccache -dv
paccache -rv

# see how much size the packages are consuming:
pacgraph -c

# listing all changed files from packages
# note: i don't understand what this actually does completely
paccheck --md5sum --quiet  

# useful info:
- no partial upgrades
  - never run pacman -Sy
  - always use pacman -Syu
  - Always upgrade (with pacman -Syu) before installing a package
  - if there's any error when running -Syu, it should be resolved asap
